## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Performed in Excel to ensure accuracy and readiness for analysis.

**Steps Taken:**
1. Removed duplicate `Customer ID` and `Date` entries.  
2. Handled missing values in **Revenue ($)**, **Units Sold**, and **Marketing Budget ($)**.  
3. Validated data types for currency, percentage, and date fields.  
4. Created new calculated columns:
   ```excel
   Revenue per Unit = Revenue / Units Sold
   Profit = Revenue - Product Cost ($)
   Profit Margin (%) = Profit / Revenue
   Marketing ROI = (Revenue - Marketing Budget) / Marketing Budget

   📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
